        <h2>Goal Setting</h2>

        <h3 id="GS1"><time datetime="2017-10-20">Oct. 20th, 2017</time></h3>

      <p>Goals</p>
      <ol>
        <li>review website code for presentation</li>
        <li>complete reading comprehension unit by lunch</li>
        <li>complete learn 2 learn unit by lunch</li>
      </ol>1.review website code for presentation
      2.complete reading comprehension unit by lunch
      3. complete learn 2 learn unit by lunch

      Reflection
      The following questions are answered in writing:

      Were the goals met? Yes or no.
      Yes, 2 of 3 goals were met

      What went well? The student describes at least 2 successful actions and describes why these actions were a 'win.'
      1. I successfully reviewed my html and css for my website presentation today. This was a win because I now have talking points to follow.  I got to this point by going through each file line by line and thinking of the why I did it and why it works the way it does.  In addition, it was useful in the larger picture for me to review my process prior to week 1 and how I would do some things differently knowing what I know now.  This will lead to refacotring musch of my code base in the future.
      2. I set a goal to complete my reading comprehension unit before lunch which made lunch into a reward for completing my work as planned.

      What didn't go well? The student describes at least 1 action that was not a success and describes why the goal wasn't met.
      I barely scratched the surface for my third goal which was completing the learn 2 learn unit. The goal wasn't met because I did not first look over the amount of material required to cover in order to complete the unit.  This was a large oersight when initially planning my goas at the beginning of the day.  I realise now that spending the time to first invetigate the work load for my desired daily goals and breaking it into smaller parts will be more time efficient as well as allowing me to have a higher success rate in completed goals.

      What will you do differently tomorrow?
      When creating my goals, I will look further into how much time will approximately be required to complete a goal before putting creating a goal post to finish it by.

        <h2>Goal Setting</h2>

        <h3 id="GS2"><time datetime="2017-10-21">Oct. 21st, 2017</time></h3>
        <p>Goals Oct 21st Clean my place 1 hour min. typing practice complete learn2learn unit start on Semantic HTML exercise
         Were the goals met? Yes or no. Only half. What went well? The student describes at least 2 successful actions and describes why
          these actions were a 'win.' Cleaned my place while listneing to the Syntax podcast. This was a great win because I was able to be immersed in the language while being away from my computer and I was able to comlete the meanial task of housework. This
          allows me to focus on the content and not the implementation right away and now I have another podcast that I will listen to regularly. I did closer to 2 hours of typing practice spread throughout the day. I utilized the pomodoro timer which helped
          keep me grounded in the tedious work of typing practice. Typing faster good. What didn't go well? The student describes at least 1 action that was not a success and describes why the goal wasn't met. I had reasonable goals for the day but I was
          allowing myself to be distracted by various forms of media. I certainly could have used my time better. The new Patton Oswalt special is great though... What will you do differently tomorrow? Tomorrow, I will not comprimise in completing all the
          goals I set. I will do this by structuring my day in a way that is not so open ended. I had all day, so I spent a big part of the day waiting around to start things. If I give myself a specific timeline to follow like start Goal 1 at 11am etc. i will
          use my time much more efficiently. Same thing with setting an end time or break times. If I have parameters that my goals must be accomplished within it will streamline my focus and overall productivity. Some of the more in depth podcasts are not
          suitable for multitasking but it is easy to tell by first reading the description of the podcast before diving in.</p>

        <h2>Goal Setting</h2>

        <h3 id="GS3"><time datetime="2017-10-22">Oct. 22nd, 2017</time></h3>
        <p>Goals October 22nd 1.Complete the first l2l drill 2.Work on Semantic HTML markup exercise 3.Visit my mom and see my nephew 4.Gym Were the goals met? Yes or no. All but the last were completed. What went well? The student describes at least 2
          successful actions and describes why these actions were a 'win.' My l2l blog was a win becuase i learned to use OBS for the first time to make a scrren recording, a skill that I'm sure will be used much more. My win was achieved by first breaking
          down into smaller parts which things had to be done first. I knew that I would need to learn how OBS works to record my screen and then I needed to find a way to host my video online and get a link that I could submit. I also took this as an
          opportunity to embrace being new to something ans not let it stress me out. I managed my expectations because I knew it wouyld be a steep learning curve at first using new software. This took a while but next time I need to do something similar(next
          blog post) it will be much easier to do. I also gave myself a specific time block to start and end my work by. This helped me to avoid waiting around to complete goals as I did yesterday. The Semantic exercise went very well and I got much further
          than planned. This was another case of looking ahead that helped me to realize the size of the work required to complete the unit as well which directly effected how much time I was going to plan for. Breezing through this practice was also a nice
          ego boost and affirmation that what I had learned Friday did sink in. I also scheduled this unit at the end of my day incase I needed mire time than expected. This helped avoid any pressure of running out of timne etc. What didn't go well? I didn't
          make it to the gym. This was just a case of laziness that I don't usually have a problem with. Also, I had prioritized completing all other goals over this one so I was prepared to let this one go if need be. What will you do differently tomorrow? I
          will absolutely hit the gym!</p>
