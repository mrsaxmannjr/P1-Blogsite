        <p class="setup">Goals</p>
        <ul class="blog-list">
          <li>Review website code for presentation</li>
          <li>Complete reading comprehension unit by lunch</li>
          <li>Complete learn 2 learn unit by lunch</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="setup">Were the goals met?</p>
        <p>Yes, 2 of 3 goals were met</p>

        <p class="setup">What went well? The student describes at least 2 successful actions and describes why these actions were a 'win.'</p>

        <p>I successfully reviewed my html and css for my website presentation today. This was a win because I now have talking points to follow. I got to this point by going through each file line by line and thinking of the why I did it and why it works
          the way it does. In addition, it was useful in the larger picture for me to review my process prior to week 1 and how I would do some things differently knowing what I know now. This will lead to refacotring musch of my code base in the future.</p>

        <p>I set a goal to complete my reading comprehension unit before lunch which made lunch into a reward for completing my work as planned.</p>

        <p class="setup">What didn't go well? The student describes at least 1 action that was not a success and describes why the goal wasn't met.</p>

        <p>I barely scratched the surface for my third goal which was completing the learn 2 learn unit. The goal wasn't met because I did not first look over the amount of material required to cover in order to complete the unit. This was a large oersight
          when initially planning my goas at the beginning of the day. I realise now that spending the time to first invetigate the work load for my desired daily goals and breaking it into smaller parts will be more time efficient as well as allowing me to
          have a higher success rate in completed goals.</p>

        <p class="setup">What will you do differently tomorrow?</p>

        <p>When creating my goals, I will look further into how much time will approximately be required to complete a goal before putting creating a goal post to finish it by.</p>

        <p class="setup">Goals</p>

        <ul class="blog-list">
        <li>Clean my place</li>
        <li>1 hour min. typing practice</li>
        <li>complete learn2learn unit</li>
        <li>start on Semantic HTML exercise</li>
      </ul>

        <p class="setup">Were the goals met?</p>
        <p>Only half.</p>

        <p class="setup">What went well? The student describes at least 2 successful actions and describes why these actions were a 'win.'</p>
        <p>Cleaned my place while listneing to the Syntax podcast. This was a great win because I was able to be immersed in the language while being away from my computer and I was able to comlete the meanial task of housework. This allows me to focus on
          the content and not the implementation right away and now I have another podcast that I will listen to regularly.</p>
        <p>I did closer to 2 hours of typing practice spread throughout the day. I utilized the pomodoro timer which helped keep me grounded in the tedious work of typing practice. Typing faster good.</p>

        <p class="setup">
          What didn't go well? The student describes at least 1 action that was not a success and describes why the goal wasn't met.</p>
        <p>
          I had reasonable goals for the day but I was allowing myself to be distracted by various forms of media. I certainly could have used my time better. The new Patton Oswalt special is great though...</p>

        <p class="setup">What will you do differently tomorrow?</p>
        <p>Tomorrow, I will not comprimise in completing all the goals I set. I will do this by structuring my day in a way that is not so open ended. I had all day, so I spent a big part of the day waiting around to start things. If I give myself a specific
          timeline to follow like start Goal 1 at 11am etc. i will use my time much more efficiently. Same thing with setting an end time or break times. If I have parameters that my goals must be accomplished within it will streamline my focus and overall
          productivity. Some of the more in depth podcasts are not suitable for multitasking but it is easy to tell by first reading the description of the podcast before diving in.</p>

        <p class="setup">Goals</p>
        <ul class="blog-list">
        <li>Complete the first l2l drill</li>
        <li>Work on Semantic HTML markup exercise</li>
        <li>Visit my mom and see my nephew</li>
        <li>Gym</li>
      </ul>
        <p class="setup">Were the goals met?</p>
        <p>All but the last were completed.</p>
        <p class="setup">
          What went well? The student describes at least 2 successful actions and describes why these actions were a 'win.'</p>
        <p>My l2l blog was a win becuase i learned to use OBS for the first time to make a scrren recording, a skill that I'm sure will be used much more.</p>
        <p>My win was achieved by first breaking down into smaller parts which things had to be done first. I knew that I would need to learn how OBS works to record my screen and then I needed to find a way to host my video online and get a link that I
          could submit. I also took this as an opportunity to embrace being new to something ans not let it stress me out. I managed my expectations because I knew it wouyld be a steep learning curve at first using new software. This took a while but next time
          I need to do something similar(next blog post) it will be much easier to do. I also gave myself a specific time block to start and end my work by. This helped me to avoid waiting around to complete goals as I did yesterday.
        </p>
        <p>The Semantic exercise went very well and I got much further than planned. This was another case of looking ahead that helped me to realize the size of the work required to complete the unit as well which directly effected how much time I was going
          to plan for. Breezing through this practice was also a nice ego boost and affirmation that what I had learned Friday did sink in. I also scheduled this unit at the end of my day incase I needed mire time than expected. This helped avoid any pressure
          of running out of timne etc.</p>
        <p class="setup">What didn't go well?</p>
        <p>I didn't make it to the gym. This was just a case of laziness that I don't usually have a problem with. Also, I had prioritized completing all other goals over this one so I was prepared to let this one go if need be. What will you do differently
          tomorrow? I will absolutely hit the gym!</p>
