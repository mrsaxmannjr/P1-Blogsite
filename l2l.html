        <p class="setup">git/github</p>

        <p>I wanted to spend some more time with git/github. I watched a 4 -part series called Github for noobs. I picked up some nice git commands and gained a better understanding of github.</p>

        <p class="setup">Set the Stage</p>

        <iframe src="https://streamable.com/s/9ltp6/awgcfo" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" allowfullscreen></iframe>

        </video>

        <p>When i set the stage, the first thing I do is mute notifications on my computer and if my phone is around, I mute and place it facedown. Next, I open a new browser window and then split the screen with my terminal. In my terminal, I will cd to
          where I need to be and then command+k to clear the history and start with a blank terminal. If I am not watching videos/podcasts, I will play some background music. Finally, I wil usualy start the pomodoro timer I have to keep me grounded for 25
          minutes minimum.</p>

        <p>Setting the stage helped me to prepare myself mentally for a new task by removing all distractions and narrowing my focus on the subject at hand. Practicing music my whole life, I have been very familiar with setting the stage etc. so I can't say
          my process in this regard has changed that drastically.</p>

        <p class="setup">Reflection</p>

        <p>I learned a few new git commands as well as how to create, delete, and switch branches in github through the terminal. My favorite command I found was git commit -am “” which will add(stage) and commit all files in one step.</p>

        <p>I also picked up a nice mindset for learning from the series. Being a "noob" at something is to be embraced as the pressure on yourself is much less if you remember that you are at the beginning of the learning process so mistakes will and have ot
          be made. They are good in fact! I also found that reading through the comments on the videos I watched would reveal some other great info from the community.</p>

        <p class="setup">HTML/CSS</p>

        <p>I decided to start from the beginning of the learn objectives of TS-1 Build multi-page websites. I wanted to do a proper review on my html and css skills before diving into the new unit.
        </p>
        <p class="setup">Set the Stage</p>

        <iframe src="https://streamable.com/s/65y39/xepvts" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" allowfullscreen ></iframe>

        <p>The first thing I did was open the intro to HTML learn file in a new window. I then muted my notifications and started my pomodoro timer. I also opened atom and split the screen between the browser and atom so I could easily implement what I was
          reading into my code.</p>

        <p>Once again, setting the stage helped me to prepare myself mentally for a new task by removing all distractions and narrowing my focus on the subject at hand.</p>

        <p class="setup">Reflection</p>

        <p>This was a good opportunity to not only review and refresh my html and css but I learned a few new things as well. I got a lot of practice using the and tags. The mdn docs for these are clearly laid out and I was able to go through a lot of the
          options such as autoplay. I like how you can choose whether or not to display the controls etc.
        </p>
        <p>I took time to go back to my personal site to review the code. My code was not very semantic at all; I used tags for nearly everything. I now have a better idea of how to use section tags semantically and will implement this in all my pages going
          forward.</p>

        <p>I still have so much to learn in this area and I need to keep reminding myself that I need to keep a growth mindset, especially when divind into new territory.

        <p class="setup">Layout with HTML/CSS</p>

        <p>I was not in the breakout Kyle did in class so I needed to watch the video and follow along at home. The video was over 1 hour long so I needed to set aside a large chunck of time that evening.
        </p>
        <p class="setup">Set the Stage</p>

        <iframe src="https://streamable.com/s/f2kf1/tzydqh" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" allowfullscreen ></iframe>

        <p>First thing I did was to finish all my non-school tasks that had to be finished so i could have the rest of the night to work on the unit. Once that was complete, I was free to focus on the task at hand without any other responsibilities hanging
          over me. Next, I muted my phone and placed it face down to eliminate that distraction. Finally, I set up my computer space. I first muted all notifications. Next, I opened the youtube link in a new window and then opened my new index.html, style.css
          and reset.css files in atom and spit the screen so I could update my code along with the video. NOw that all distractions were removed, I could fully focus on the task at hand productively.</p>

        <p class="setup">Reflection</p>

        <p>At first, I thought learning the material through a video and not via direct instruction would be a problem. I quickly learned that having the lecture on video allowed me to pause and rewind during the lecture which with Kyle is often needed
          because he moves pretty quick. This allowed me to code along with him but I would pause to code so I could still focus on the instruction. Before watching the video, flexbox seemed so alien to me. Although he barely covered flex, te amount that was
          shown really sorted out my nerves and doubts. I was able to recreate exactly what was on his screen on mine which was a great feeling. Moving forward, I will use apply my video leaning mindset whenever I have to learn via a video lecture.</p>
