        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <img class="aboutme-pic" src="profilepic.jpg" alt="profile pic">
        <p>My name is James Mann. I am a Colorado native and I was raised in Fort Lupton, CO. I studied at the University of Colorado, Boulder and received Bachelor's degrees in Music Performance (Saxophone, Jazz studies) and Music Education. I have been active in the music scene all over Colorado through performance and teaching. I maintained a studio of 22 private students through Miller Music in Longmont as well as leading masterclasses/clinics in a few high schools.</p>

        <p>I have been playing music professionally for 15 years and for the last 11 years I have been traveling the world as a Music Director/Musician (Saxes, Flute, Clarinet) for Princess Cruises. I spent the last 5 months traveling (eating) all over Japan.</p>

        <p>I am currently a member of the Galvanize Web Development Immersive, cohort g70. </p>
