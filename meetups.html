        <p class="setup">Meetup Information</p>

        <p>The first meetup I went to was the DenverScript meetup on October 24th, at CodeTalent. The meeting covered Chrome Dev tools (Chrome 60) and CSS Variables.</p>

        <p class="setup">People I Met</p>

        <p>I met James Sullivan, a recent Turing Web Dev graduate. James is on the job hunt and optimistically so. James cited the meetups as a great place to network, pick up new skills and score free meals.</p>

        <p>I first met Guillermo Moratorio on the 4th floor Platte balcony and then again at this meetup. Guillermo is a Galvanize graduate and works as software developer at Voalte. Super nice guy!</p>

        <p class="setup">What I Learned</p>

        <p>I learned that CSS variables (custom properties) permit the declaration and usage of cascading variables in stylesheets. This is considered experimental but is 78% globally supported.</p>

        <p>I learned that I was able to understand the syntax in the lightning talks for the most part.</p>

        <p>I learned that the Chrome dev tools are an extremely helpful tool that is constantly being updated. The talk was on Chrome 60 and 61 has already been released. The updates make it easier to work directly in the console when debugging and editing
          code.</p>

        <p>Objects in the console now display more information than before.</p>

        <p class="setup">Questions I Have</p>

        <ul class="blog-list">
          <li>Will we be learning about CSS Variables at Galvanize/is it a "game changer"?</li>

          <li>Is it best practice to use the dev tools for all debugging etc.?</li>

          <li>The dev tools have SO MANY different menus etc., what are the main functions to learn?</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="setup">Meetup Information</p>

        <p>The second meetup that I attended was the Mavrck Happy Hour. This was on the 4th floor of Galvanize, Platte campus on Nov. 1st.</p>

        <p class="setup">People I Met</p>

        <p>The company only has 4 people working here in Denver and I met two of them.</p>

        <p>Both Madison and Sydney worked together for another company before Mavrck and they were hired on as a group. The company is actually based in Boston; they don't have an official office so they work in the shared space on the 4th floor.</p>

        <p class="setup">What I Learned</p>

        <p>I first learned that some of the people working on the 4th floor may actually be lacking an office space and just camp out at the shared tables.</p>

        <p>I learned about Mavrck as a company. I didn't realize such a job existed. As far as I could tell, it seems the company is a talent agency for internet celebrities and such. I also learned what an influencer is and that you must have a base number
          of followers to be considered one.
        </p>
        <p class="setup">Questions I Have</p>

        <ul class="blog-list">
          <li>Is influencer marketing a big industry?</li>
          <li>Is influencer marketing necessary?</li>
          <li>How does a business work without a dedicated work space?</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="setup">Meetup Information</p>

        <p>The third meetup I attended was about transitioning to Java 8 from Java 7. The meetup was hosted by Women Who Code at Galvanize, Platte campus on Nov. 1st.</p>

        <p class="setup">People I Met</p>

        <p>I first met Nowai Matthew, the director of WWC in Denver. She stated that she was a front-end dev but she had some good input and seemed to follow the Java presentation without issue. Nowai works as an Application Engineer for Lyons Consulting Group.</p>

        <p>The presenter was Laura Patterson. She had a lot of valuable insight on what it's like to move to a new version of software within a corporate structure. Laura had a lot of great info and she was able to convey most of it clearly and concisely.
          Laura works as a Java software engineer for AppNexus.</p>

        <p class="setup">What I Learned</p>

        <p>With Java being way out of my current league, I mainly learned about the greater scope of of how companies deal with implementing upgrades and how as an individual you should never become complacent with your current skillset.</p>

        <p>I learned that you may end up working at a place that does not require you to learn new skills to complete the day to day. This means that it is very easy to become stagnant with your skillset if you don't constantly push yourself to evolve. Some
          of the benefits of pushing yourself to learn the new tools is that you can present a case to your employer why they could/should upgrade if they havenâ€™t on their own.</p>

        <p>I learned that upgrades my be "shiny and new" but most of the time, a large company will prefer stability over shiny new features.</p>

        <p>I also learned that i was only allowed to attend this meetup because i came with a women; which the director of the group decided was important to announce.</p>

        <p class="setup">Questions I Have</p>

        <ul class="blog-list">
          <li>This information presented here was all geared toward back-end development and others I have seen were geared towards front-end. Do the majority of people fall into either one as opposed to being full-stack?</li>

          <li>Is Java considered to be a modern standard for most companies?</li>

          <li>Will we be learning Java during the WDI at Galvanize?</li>
